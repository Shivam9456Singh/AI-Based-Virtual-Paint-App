-----------------APP---------------------------

Developed an OpenCV application integrated with AI for real-time hand motion detection to facilitate virtual painting. 
However, I am encountering some challenges with the output when deploying the application through Heroku. 
For your reference, I have provided a demonstration image and a video showcasing the functionality of the "AI Virtual Painter" app.

OR

**To initiate the "AI Virtual Painter" application on your local machine, please begin by downloading the provided `.zip` archive of the repository. Upon downloading, proceed to extract all the contents contained within the archive. Once extraction is complete, simply execute the `AIPainter.py` script. Following this, the application should be operational on your local host environment.**

**If you require any further instructions or assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.**

---Having some issues in Camera Addon on Heroku, so won't be able to give you the output video but it will only show the fully functional dynamic website ,  if you want to run the app on your machine then just download the .zip File on your machine. After some installations it will work on Local server as Shown in the Demo .
